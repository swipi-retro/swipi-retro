# System Files for a Single User

If you want your current user to have the correct permissions, you'll still need some system level files to be installed.

This set up removes the complexity of starting and stopping a process by a different user. It also allows the original devices to be seen when MoltenGamepad is not running. Run `./configure.sh <YOUR USER NAME>` and `./install.sh` from this directory to deploy this setup.
